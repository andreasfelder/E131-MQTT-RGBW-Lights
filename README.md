## These lights have firmware written specifically for them:

  - includes HTTP page for firmware updates instead of OTA - make sure to modify the login info

Firmware is uploaded for the Sonoff B1, I highly recommend using the Lohas instead, they are cheaper and have better white and color performance.

## Use These upload settings:
